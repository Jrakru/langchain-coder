## Introduction

GPT Coder is a state-of-the-art code generation tool powered by OpenAI. It provides a seamless experience for developers to generate code snippets in various languages based on the provided prompts. The tool is integrated with advanced AI models like GPT-3.5, GPT-3.5 Turbo, and GPT-4, ensuring high-quality code outputs.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Code Generation and Completion**: Utilizes OpenAI models for efficient and accurate code suggestions.
- **Save and Execute Code**: Provides options to save the generated code and execute it instantly.
- **Coding Guidelines**: Ensures the generated code adheres to standards like modularity, exception handling, error handling, logging, comments, efficiency, robustness, memory management, speed optimization, and naming conventions.
- **Advanced Code Editor**: Customize your coding experience with features like adjustable font size, tab size, themes, keybindings, line numbers, print margins, wrapping, auto-updates, read-only mode, and language selection.
- **Offline and Online Compilation Modes**: Choose between offline and online compiler modes for code execution.

## AI-Sections.
### ü§ñ OpenAI 
- **Customizable Settings**: Adjust Tokens, Temperature, and set your API Key directly in the settings.
- **Model Selection**: Choose from a variety of models including GPT 3.5, GPT 3.5 Turbo, and the latest GPT 4.
### üåê LangChain and liteLLM Proxy
- **Code Generation**: Uses LangChain and liteLLM proxy to generate the code.
- **GPT4-Free API**: Leverages the GPT4-Free API for code generation. Please note that this should only be used non-commercially.

## WebUI - Application Showcase
