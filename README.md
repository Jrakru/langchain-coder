## Introduction

LangChain Coder AI is a state-of-the-art code generation tool powered by OpenAI and Vertex AI. It provides a seamless experience for developers to generate code snippets in various languages based on the provided prompts. The tool is integrated with advanced AI models like GPT-3.5, GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4, Code Gecko, and Code Bison, ensuring high-quality code outputs.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Code Generation and Completion**: Utilizes OpenAI and Vertex AI models for efficient and accurate code suggestions.
- **Save and Execute Code**: Provides options to save the generated code and execute it instantly.
- **Coding Guidelines**: Ensures the generated code adheres to standards like modularity, exception handling, error handling, logging, comments, efficiency, robustness, memory management, speed optimization, and naming conventions.
- **Advanced Code Editor**: Customize your coding experience with features like adjustable font size, tab size, themes, keybindings, line numbers, print margins, wrapping, auto-updates, read-only mode, and language selection.
- **Customizable Settings**: Adjust settings like temperature, max tokens, model name, project, region, and credentials file for Vertex AI.
- **Offline and Online Compilation Modes**: Choose between offline and online compiler modes for code execution.

## AI-Sections.
### ü§ñ OpenAI 
- **Customizable Settings**: Adjust Tokens, Temperature, and set your API Key directly in the settings.
- **Model Selection**: Choose from a variety of models including GPT 3.5, GPT 3.5 Turbo, and the latest GPT 4.

### üåê Vertex AI 
- **Customizable Settings**: Fine-tune Tokens, Temperature, and set your Credentials Key in the settings.
- **Model Selection**: Opt for models like **Code Gecko** for completions and **Code Bison** for code generation. These models are designed to support code completion and generation, enhancing your coding experience.

## OpenAI Integration
LangChain Coder AI integrates with [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) to leverage its powerful machine learning models for code generation. OpenAI is an AI research and deployment company For more details on how LangChain integrates with OpenAI, refer to the [official documentation](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/providers/openai).

You need Open AI API **Key** to use LangChain Coder AI. To get your key, follow these steps:
### Get OpenAI API key

1. Go to the [OpenAI website](https://beta.openai.com/signup/).
2. Fill out the form with your information and click ‚ÄúCreate Account‚Äù.
3. Once you are logged in, click on ‚ÄúAPI Keys‚Äù in the left-hand menu.
4. Click on ‚ÄúGenerate New Key‚Äù to create a new API key.
5. Copy your API key ‚Äì we will use it later in our Python code.

## Vertex AI Integration

LangChain Coder AI integrates with [Google Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/aiplatform/latest) to leverage its powerful machine learning models for code generation. Vertex AI offers a range of tools and services for ML and AI, and LangChain Coder AI taps into these resources to provide top-notch code suggestions. For more details on how LangChain integrates with Vertex AI, refer to the [official documentation](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/llms/google_vertex_ai_palm).

Additionally, the Vertex AI SDK for Python allows for automation of data ingestion, model training, and predictions on Vertex AI. It provides a programmatic way to access most of the functionalities available in the Google Cloud console. For more information, check out the [Vertex AI SDK for Python](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/python-sdk/use-vertex-ai-python-sdk).

You need Google Vertex **Service Account Credentials** to use LangChain Coder AI. To get your credentials, follow these steps:

### Credentials for Google Vertex AI Service account

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Platform Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Click the **Menu** button (three horizontal lines) in the top left corner of the page.
3. Select **IAM & Admin** > **Service accounts**.
4. Click the **Create Service Account** button.
5. In the **Service account name** field, enter a name for your service account.
6. Select the **Editor** role for the service account.
7. Click the **Create** button.
8. Click the **Keys** tab.
9. Click the **Add Key** button.
10. Select **JSON** as the key type.
11. Click the **Create** button.

After downloading the file in `JSON` format you need to upload it in the application. To do so, follow these steps:
Enter the project name and location of that project and you're all set to go.

Here is sample Service JSON file.
```json
{
  "type": "service_account",
  "project_id": "my-project-id",
  "private_key_id": "my-private-key-id",
  "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nmy-private-key\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
  "client_email": "my-service-account@my-project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
  "client_id": "my-client-id"
}
```
